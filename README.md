# Does Race or Language Influence Implicit Biases?
An analysis of data from an implicit bias test conducted on economics students. 

## Introduction 

The implicit bias test* assesses participants' categorization of words into specific groups such as flowers, insects, pleasant, and unpleasant.
This study aims to explore implicit bias prevalence among economics students at UCSB, 
focusing on the following racial groups: white, asian, and other (non-white and non-Asian. I.e., Hispanic).

## Method + Data Collection
The test was divided into two parts: q65 and q66. 
q65 seeks to elicit implicit biases, while q66 acts as a control. 
Forty-five ECON 145 students participated. 
Two participants did not finish the test and were excluded from analysis. 
Thus, the following analyses are based on the the 43 students who completed the study. 
Table 1 displays the racial breakdown of these 43 participants.

## Analysis: Race
Figure 1 plots the time it took each participant to complete each portion of the test (q65 and q66), as grouped by race. The average completion times for q65 and q66 were 101.15s and 62.94s, respectively, for all races (these values are depicted as solid lines in fig. 1). 
Numerical tabulations of the percentage of each race that fell above or below the total average for all races for q65 and q66 can be found in tables 2 and 3, respectively.
For the control (q66), the average time for completion was 62.94s, with the majority of white students (90.90%) completing the question faster than their asian or non-white/non-asian peers. Both asian and non-asian/non-white respondents were approx. evenly split above and below the total average.
For q65, the average time for completion was substantially longer at 101.15s, which was expected as this portion of the test is designed to be confusing. While asian and non-asian/non-white participants performed somewhat similarly to the control as compared to the average, a greater share of white participants took longer than the average to complete q65.

## Analysis: Language

I will now focus on the effect of native language on the total time.

Of the 43 students, 19 were native English speakers, and 24 were non-native English speakers. 

Figure 2 displays the time it took native and non-native English speakers to complete each portion of the test, q65 and q66. 
The data is visualized in a violin plot of the data, with each question’s average response time (including both native and non-native English speakers) displayed as gray lines. 
The dots above the average represent respondents with above-average response times and vice-versa for below-average respondents. 
From Figure 2, we can glean that native English speakers had a clear advantage for both portions of the test. 
From this plots, it is evident that native speakers had lower median response times than non-native speakers for both questions. 
Furthermore, participants had quicker response times on average for q66 than q65, which is to be expected.
Non-native speakers exhibited a wider range in q66, suggesting it may have been relatively more challenging for them compared to native speakers. 
The spread for both groups is greater in q65 than in q66, possibly reflecting the fact that q65 was difficult for both native and non-native English speakers.

Additionally, non-Native speakers had larger variance above the average than below, possibly reflecting various levels of English proficiency.

## Conclusion

### Race
While longer response times among white participants in q65 may suggest potential implicit biases, this assertion lacks substantiation. Further data analysis is required to investigate the accuracy of these respondents' answers.

### Language
It is evident that one’s native language plays a role in determining the completion time of these tests. Further analysis is needed to evaluate the effect of language on test accuracy as it relates to
completion time.
